[2021/2/25-16:6-input]	 @dan	... I managded to line up *some* enemies with their attack animations. Some enemy animations were too long for their

[2021/2/25-16:13-input]	  For instance, mosquite atto is quite fast and attacks every 06.6 seoncconds.
[2021/2/25-16:13-input]	  If art creates an attack with the 'release' frame at that time... do we eimagine they will get any faster?
[2021/2/25-16:14-input]	 I like to add a little iwwwiggle room by dyanamically changing the sepeed of the animations so it's a bit more resitstant to change. We (as long we as we don't change it too much, should look fine).
