I'm hoping this will make google change. There's a lot of horror stories of people losing all
 their google hemails/etc... if you're popupllar enough on twitter it gets fixed. If not, you're out of oulluck.

I think the issue is though, that very often it will never get resolved, as google deoesn't have enough people doing that, as they want to anautomate everything.
 It's very kafakaesque. 
They will probably reosolve this case, but, doesn't sound like
 
this guy will be making ettteerriair
aria for google stadiua, as thhis principle isis, if you're not the guy making terriaaria for good gle stadiu ht aa then this probably won't bget resolved.
 And that's not ok with him
